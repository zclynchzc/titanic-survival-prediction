# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Purpose:
This machine learning model is trained to accurately predict survivors in response to [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) on Kaggle

## Technical Goals:
* Clean data on passengers of the Titanic and dynamically fill missing values
* Predict which passengers survived using multivariate logistic regression
* Manipulate the data using Python, Pandas, and NumPy; train regression model using Scikit-Learn

## Resources:
* Libraries:
    * Python
        * Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
* Data:
    * Training and test datasets from Kaggle
